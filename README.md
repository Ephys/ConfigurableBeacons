# Configurable Beacons

Configurable Beacons is a modification for minecraft 1.12.1 that lets you customize the behavior of vanilla beacon.

## Features

- Turn off particles when the player has a beacon effect active
- Change how the horizontal range is calculated
- Change what the vertical range behavior is (Vanilla Java, Vanilla Bedrock and ignore Y axis)

## Planned features

- Add and Remove valid payment items (I'm a big fan of making the emerald the only valid payment item)
